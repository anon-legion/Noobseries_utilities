wifi_stored_password.exe creates a text file "WIFI_stored_{date_tag}.txt" with all the wifi SSIDs and PWs stored on the device on it
useful when you've forgotten the PW of a wifi you've connected to or just sharing wifi accounts so others can connect to them also.
does not require internet to work, the utility does not actively/passively log wifi accounts it only recovers it when you run it
